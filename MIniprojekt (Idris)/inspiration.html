                <span>Sports:</span> I'm not talking about sports individually, neither hockey or baseball or
                baskerball. I'm talking about the spirit of sport - the drive and desire and
                hard work that it takes to be the best and compete and practive to be better because
                you love something.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Charity:</span> There are a lot of people who need help in our world and there are alot of
                people out there doing their very best to give it to them. Every time I see someone
                working hard to create change or make life better for people I am inspired and honoured
                to be part of the things that i can be.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>The internet:</span> It is so full of possibilities and information and amazing
                things that i cant help but be inspired by it.
            </li>
